"There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children‚Äù, said Nelson Mandela. But how does India treat its children?

Everyday there are several cases of crimes against children reported in the media. There are statistics and reports published by various organizations. We know from them that the crimes against children are prevalent and serious. But often the information is scattered and might not holistically convey the situation and its severity. Here is beginning of an attempt to bring all information at one place, create interactive maps and visualizations, explore patterns and provide basis for causal explanations of the crimes based on these patterns and geographic distribution. We also hope to raise awareness and suggest improvements by applying the best practices of data science and algorithms.

The data has been taken from <a href="http://data.gov.in/"> Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India</a> and refers to district wise details on crimes against children under various crime categories.
